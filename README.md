# Temporal KT

A Kotlin-first wrapper around the [Temporal Core SDK](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core).

**This is NOT a drop in replacement for [temporal-java](https://docs.temporal.io/develop/java)**. This is a complete
redesign of the SDK to provide a more idiomatic Kotlin experience, leveraging Kotlin language features

Currently, this is super in development and in the move fast break things phase. Expect breaking changes frequently.


## Using Temporal KT

Read [./docs/GETTING_STARTED.md](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) for a full getting started guide.


## Developing Temporal KT

Read [./docs/DEV_SETUP.md](docs/DEV_SETUP.md) for development setup and architecture overview.
